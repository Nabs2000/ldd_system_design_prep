### ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

You are designing a **Car Parking Lot System**.

There are two types of parking spots:

1. **Compact spots** â†’ only accept small cars.
2. **Large spots** â†’ accept both large cars and small cars.

Rules:

* A car **must have a valid parking pass** to be accepted.
* Each spot type has a **capacity limit**.
* In the future, the parking lot may **ban electric cars without charging support**, so your design should make this easy to extend.

Your job is to design the following functions:

1. **park\_car(car)** â†’ tries to park a car into an appropriate spot.
2. **remove\_car(car)** â†’ removes a car from the parking lot.
