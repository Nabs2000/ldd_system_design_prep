ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

You are designing a Car Parking Lot System.

There are two types of parking spots:

Compact spots â†’ only accept small cars.

Large spots â†’ accept both large cars and small cars.

Rules:

A car must have a valid parking pass to be accepted.

Each spot type has a capacity limit.

In the future, the parking lot may ban electric cars without charging support, so your design should make this easy to extend.

Your job is to design the following functions:

park_car(car) â†’ tries to park a car into an appropriate spot.

remove_car(car) â†’ removes a car from the parking lot.
